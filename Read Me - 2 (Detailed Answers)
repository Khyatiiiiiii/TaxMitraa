Alternatives Considered
Include alternate design ideas here which you are leaning away from.
1. Full Automation with Direct E-Filing Integration
Alternative Considered:
Directly integrating with government tax portals to enable one-click e-filing.
Automatically submitting returns without requiring users to manually review their details.
Why We Rejected It:
Security & Privacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data (PAN, Aadhaar, tax records) and directly filing on behalf of users could pose legal and data privacy risks.
Lack of API Accessibility: Government APIs for tax filing are not publicly available or standardized, making integration unreliable and complex.
User Control: Taxpayers should have the final say in reviewing their returns before submission to avoid potential errors and liabilities.
2. Storing User’s Financial Data for Future Tax Filing
Alternative Considered:
Maintaining a user database to store tax records, previous filings, and financial details for automated tax filing in future years.
Why We Rejected It:
Data Privacy Risks: Storing sensitive financial information could increase the risk of data breaches, even with encryption.
Compliance Challenges: Legal restrictions around data retention and financial information storage make this approach difficult to implement securely.
User Preference for Anonymity: Many users may not want their financial data stored and prefer a system that works without long-term data retention.
3. AI-Only Approach Without Human Review
Alternative Considered:
Fully automating tax calculations, deductions, and form selection without any manual review or validation from the user.
Why We Rejected It:
User Accountability: Taxpayers are responsible for their filings, and a completely automated system could lead to mistakes if the AI misinterprets certain inputs.
Edge Cases & Complex Tax Situations: AI may struggle with exceptional cases (e.g., capital gains, foreign income, multiple income sources), requiring manual review and adjustments.
Regulatory Concerns: Tax filing regulations frequently change, requiring human oversight to ensure compliance with the latest laws.
