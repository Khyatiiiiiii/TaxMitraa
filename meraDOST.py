        "Income Tax is a tax levied by the Government of India on the income earned by individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), companies, firms, and other entities as per the Income Tax Act, 1961. It's a direct tax, meaning the person earning the income pays it directly to the government.\n\n**Who needs to pay Income Tax?**\n\nGenerally, any individual or entity whose total income exceeds the basic exemption limit specified by the government is required to pay income tax. This limit is revised annually during the budget.\n\n**For the Assessment Year 2024-25 (Financial Year 2023-24), the basic exemption limits are as follows (under the old tax regime):**\n\n*   **Individuals below 60 years of age:** ₹ 2,50,000\n*   **Senior Citizens (60 years or more but less than 80 years):** ₹ 3,00,000\n*   **Super Senior Citizens (80 years or more):** ₹ 5,00,000\n\n**Under the New Tax Regime (default regime unless opted out), the basic exemption limit is ₹3,00,000 for all individuals, irrespective of age.**\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n*   Income includes salary, business profits, rental income, capital gains, and income from other sources.\n*   Even if your income is below the basic exemption limit, you may still need to file an Income Tax Return (ITR) if you meet certain other criteria, such as having assets abroad or holding a certain level of financial transactions.\n*   Tax rates vary based on income slabs, age, and the tax regime chosen (Old vs. New).\n*   You can reduce your tax liability by claiming deductions under various sections of the Income Tax Act, such as Section 80C, 80D, etc.\n\nIt's always advisable to consult a tax professional or refer to the official Income Tax Department website (www.incometax.gov.in) for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n",
